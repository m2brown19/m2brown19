- Hi, I’m Michael Brown!
- I am a recent UVA grad with experience in SWE and hacking. 
- I’m interested in programming, cyber R&D, network security, reverse engineering, forensics, red teaming, and penetration testing.
- My github is currently under maintenance construction. I have my calorie counter / meal builder and awesome projects that I completed at UVA on here including my Metasploit modules that I built to hack a Windows machine. I have a recipe hosting website that is currently under maintenance as I am transitioning it from using Microsoft Azure to AWS.
- NOTE: I made my repo for UVA work private due to concerns about honor policy. If you are an employer and wish to see my projects, please contact me and I can show you.
