- Hi, I’m Michael Brown!
- I am a recent UVA grad with experience in SWE and hacking. 
- I have awesome network, cryptocurrency, and OS projects that I completed at UVA on here (including my Metasploit modules that I built to hack a Windows machine).
- I have a recipe hosting website that is currently under maintenance as I am transitioning it from using Microsoft Azure to AWS. It is in a private repo, but I will post the link as soon as I fix it.
- Interested in programming, DevOps, cyber R&D, network security, reverse engineering, forensics, red teaming, and penetration testing.
